                They say time moves at one second per second and it never slows down nor speed up in a general sense, but I believe this is false as whenever I am with you time seems to slow down

            Can I tell you a secret?. I'm also pretty bad at talking about my feelings, but boy oh boy I've learned over time it's just best to get started and it will work itself out as you talk. For example, When you take time into account. It only moves in one direction forward, forever never to see the end of itself. You can see I'm digressing here haha. Anyways just like time, life also moves in a straight line, except life may end at any time

            Hi qt.

            Can I tell you a secret?. I'm also pretty bad about talkng about my feelings, but as I've lived I've come to the realization that there are very few people that will listen let alone care and I want you to know that I will listen and care, so do not be afraid to just tell me about them even at random, no matter how small or big they are. I want you to know that there is nothing you can say that's wrong. Of course you and I handle feelings differently. I supress all my emotions, Idk why couldn't really tell ya maybe that's just how I grew up but I will tell you it's not a good way to live your life and I know the hardest thing is to start talking about them and to start expressing them. Ever since we started dating you've I have managed little by little to get better and better at talking about it mostly through words so Thank you and know I'm here to help you too. It takes time and you've already taken significant steps by getting better at texting and admitting you are bad at it.
