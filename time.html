                They say time moves at one second per second and it never slows down nor speed up in a general sense, but I believe this is false as whenever I am with you time seems to slow down	                They say time moves at one second per second and it never slows down nor speed up in a general sense, but I believe this is false as whenever I am with you time seems to slow down and imagine how crazy it is that we both exist during the same exact time. In the scientific community they believe that the universe is 13 billion years old and the earth 4 billion years old, although humans have only existed for 200,000 years you and I could have been born in drastically different time periods to live remarkably different lives. The chance that we both exist together in the same time let alone the same city is crazzzzzzzzzy,but let me be honest with you would you like to know a secret?. I'm also pretty bad about talkng about my feelings like so bad that this letter is the 5th one that I've written(Jamie this is the 5th like holy moly am I bad at this lol. I kept trying to make it sound perfect, but I've realized it would be better if it came from the heart), but as I've lived I've come to the realization that there are very few people that will listen let alone care and I want you to know that I will listen and care, so do not be afraid to just tell me about them even at random, no matter how small or big they are. I want you to know that there is nothing you can say that's wrong. <br><br>I first had a crush on you in 7th grade. I remember it like it was yesterday we didn't see eachother much but we would spend the time between leaving school and waiting for the bus just talking the time away and you know what they say "If you love someone let them go, If it is meant to be they will come back" so came High school and we fell out of touch I let you go. I let you go become a butterfly. 11th grade comes around and we start to see eachother again not much talking, but in the hallways everytime I see you, you'd smile and I'd smile and give you a soft bump on the arm, I always looked forward to that part of my day haha. Then 12th grade comes around and all over sudden you came back, I let you go and you came back. Timing is important so this time I knew I had to go for it. You asked me to homecoming I agreed, then came homecoming night September 22nd, 2019: at exactly 1:36 AM I dropped you off at your house and made it official and two months later here we are. Here is to two months and many more
