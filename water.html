                Three down. Many more to go. Happy Three months Qt 3.14
                <br></br>
                Most high school relationships do not see three months, but in my opinion if you date someone for less than three months it's really more of a waste because you never actually got to know the person, their likes, dis-likes, values, etc. Every relationship requires work because you both go in with flaws and you tell each other these flaws and work together to fix them because once you've taken that next step the "I" because "we" and this is one of the major reasons as to why I've tried to help as much and as best as I could for every problem you've faced that you've told me and even those problems that you've told me about and I can't do anything about I hope I've been there as a caring ear for your to voice them out because even just talking about them helps and if you worried that I wouldn't understand them, don't, cause I'll try my best and yeah I'll be honest there probably will be a problem here and there that I won't understand same goes for you cause nobody is perfect after all. Now that being said I love you just the way you are and I've never been the guy to try to change people to fit "my view" of how they should be and I would never do that with you, but the reason I've been so pushy about you getting better at texting is because it's not about changing you but about making you a better you. A you who has a better relationship with me, your family, and your friends because communication is the number one thing that matters in all of these parts. I encourage you to be talkative because I've seen first hand how much better a life can become. I remember at Chick Fil A that one day I told you about how I struggled to talk to my dad, but there is more to that story 
                <br><br><br>
                Why did I choose this format?
                <br><br>
                I've never been the type of guy to celebrate small things, but in our relationship I would like to make a habit of celebrating those sweet moments even if in the long term they tend to get compressed and diluted. First month I got you a letter you probably still have it somewhere but I had a problem with that letter. It was small and yeah I could probably fit an entire paragraph on there if needed, but then it would look all messy and stuff and then one day I was browsing Twitter on a computer and whenever you like a tweet the little heart like sparkles and it reminded me of you so I was like heck instead of a card how about I take that heart and implement it somehow. A week later, a couple hours staring at my screen and I figured it out. Boom a webpage. They can last forever, you can look at it anywhere in the world, Extremely customizable, etc from there on I decided to name it time just because of how much time it took me to come up with the idea, also because the time we've spent together is just precious and important. There is a reason as to why this one is named Water too(Ask and I'll let you know)and next month....... You'll just have to wait to find out haha.

            <!-- When you look into the sky you see a dot. A small Dot. We call this dot the Moon. Now space is filled with a bunch of these dots, some big, some small. The beautiful thing is that they all share this invisible connection called gravity and just between the Earth and moon we can notice this connection. We call them Tides, whenever the Moon's gravity pulls and pushes the ocean further inland and back. Human life works a lot like this water. We have our highs(High Tides) and lows(Low tide) and usually they are caused by things we have no control over just like the ocean has no control over the moon. Now we have one special thing. We can control how we handle all of this but along the ways we all have a little hiccups here and there. Or in my case a ton lmao. There is a poem called *The burried life* that puts this better than I could do myself. -->
