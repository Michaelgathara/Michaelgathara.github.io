                        Would the clock still tick every second if no one was there? Every time you imagine this scenario, there is always still a conscious observer, you. Remove your conscious experience from your imagined scenario. Can’t do it? That’s simply because without an observer, reality can’t be envisioned. This includes time. There is no such thing as a real, fixed speed of time that we can imagine. Time is perceived by the brain only. Your only concept of time is based on your perception of time through your own mind. Time in your mind is perceived at a rate dictated by your consciousness. This means there is no set perceived “speed” of time. The entire universe could be perceived to happen instantaneously or sluggishly depending on your consciousness.

                <p class="think">
                    <!-- Ahhhhhh accomplishments -->
                    An individual is often judged by their accomplishments. but the societal view of succeeding is mostly viewed by how much money you have and for a brief time I remember there was a campaign to measure success by happiness and this did not work out as well as I had hoped it would. But anyways back to accomplishments. How do you define an accomplishment? Google and Bing defines it as 
                    <br><br><q>Something that has been achieved successfully.</q><br><br>
                    Very cool Google. Very cool Bing.
                    <br>
                    Duck Duck Go takes it a step farther.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <q>The act of accomplishing or the state of being accomplished; completion</q>
                    <br> Very cool Duck Duck Go<br><br>
                    At some point we have to ask ourselves what we have accomplished in life or usually its in a more job interview-ishhh setting. As far as I see I would define it as setting a goal and achieving that goal so basically like Google, Bing, Duck Duck Go, and like 90% of the universe. The problem with defining it like this is that at some point or another we all set goals that seem unlikely to happen and then get sad whenever we do not accomplish our goals. Being big sad = Big No No. So instead of setting big goals we should set small goals time and time again in order to accomplish something bigger. Big happy = Big Yes Yes.

                <h3 class="date">Would past smart people be just as smart today?</h3>
                <p class="think">- I do firmly believe that smart people in the past would be just as smart today. I do think that a smart person can not be judged by a collective of tests, but rather a test on whatever their strongest skill may be. Now of course you may say nah dip everyone ends up focusing on one skill after high school whether or not you choose to go to college and at some point you reach a level that if you were tested in this skill/focus you would score in a very high level. That said if we took someone such as Da Vinci and brought him to the present as a baby. You nurture this child as Da Vinci was nurtured. You let him sleep in 20 minute naps every 4 hours like he used too. You give him the time to think, reflect, imagine, and prototype then he would have been able to accomplish today's equivalent of what he had accomplished in his time. Nurture is a very important in how a child sees the world and changes the world.</p>

                <h3 class="date">Life?. What's up with that?</h3>
                <p class="think">- Life truly is beautiful. I mean if we look at it at an universal scale; the universe is 13.8 billion years old; the earth at 4 billion years old. Yet with the universe being so old and so big we have never found traces of nor other intelligent life out there. This means for this text we will safely assume we are the most intelligent species in the entire universe. Feels good to say that doesn't it?. Yeah. Yeah I think so imagine being part of the most intelligent species in not only the world, the solar system, the milky way but the entire universe. It's incredible. I digress though. We should all take sometime at night to go outside and just stare at the sky. Take in all the darkness or if you are in a dark place you can take in all the stars, many of which are billions of miles away. We argue a lot about what happens after we die, whether we go to heaven or hell or if this life is the last or if there is more to come after this, but really wouldn't it be cool to just watch yourself fly through the cosmos just once at least so you can touch the stars and maybe even become one with the stars?. I think that would be pretty cool to experience. Life is nothing but a journey one of which you get to set small goals for yourself and try to work to these goals. The goals don't have to be small. A simple goal for someone dealing with depression might be to just wake up the next day and go to the store and get some milk. For our high achievers they may set the goal or starting a company and reaching 1 million, 1 billion dollars in revenue. Really none of the big goals matter because setting small do able goals is how you achieve big monumental ones. Da Vinci never slept for a night he would take a 20 minute nap every four hours as a way to recharge this means he only got 5 hours of sleep per 24 hours. He would set these small goals that he can accomplish every 4 hours and then work to them then take a nap to get refreshed and tackle the problem again if he had not finished it earlier. These small goals helped him become one of the smartest individuals to have ever lived. I guess I really just went on a rant for no reason really, but the take away is. The meaning of life is to make small goals to accomplish big things until you feel as if you are satisfied enough in life to die.</p>
